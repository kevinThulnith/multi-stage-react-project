---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Containerize Game Cave with Docker for consistent deployment across any environment! Perfect for development, testing, and production deployments.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure Docker is installed on your system:

```bash
# Check if Docker is installed
docker --version

# Check if Docker Compose is available
docker compose version
```

> **Need Docker?** Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

#### Method 1: Direct Docker Build & Run

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd multi-stage-react-project
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build --build-arg VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=__GEMINI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER__ -t game-cave:latest . --no-cache
   ```

   > **Note:** Using `--build-arg VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` passes the API key as a build argument to enable AI-powered features in games like Hangman, Word Scramble, and Tic Tac Toe. Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

3. **Verify the image was created:**

   ```bash
   docker images | grep game-cave
   ```

4. **Run the container:**

   ```bash
   # Run created docker image
   docker run -p 5173:5173 game-cave:dev

   # Run created docker image as background process
   docker run -d -p 5173:5173 game-cave:dev

   # Run created docker image with custome container name
   docker run -p 5173:5173 --name game-cave-dev game-cave:dev

   # With AI Features
   docker run -d -p 5173:5173 -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key --name game-cave game-cave:latest
   ```

5. **Access your games:**
   - 🌐 **Local:** http://localhost:5173
   - 📱 **Network:** http://your-ip-address:5173

#### Method 2: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd multi-stage-react-project

# Start the application with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose down

On the `docker` branch, Compose exposes Nginx on port 5173 by default for a static SPA build. On the `docker+ssr` branch, Compose starts both the SSR Node app and Nginx, with Nginx reverse‑proxying traffic to the app (typically on port 3000) and serving static assets directly for optimal performance.
```

### 🔧 Advanced Configuration

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# Run with custom environment variables
docker run -p 5173:5173 \
  -e NODE_ENV=development \
  -e VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  --name game-cave-dev \
  game-cave:dev
```

#### Volume Mounting for Development

```bash
# Mount source code for hot reload during development
docker run -p 5173:5173 \
  -v "$(pwd):/app" \
  -v /app/node_modules \
  --name game-cave-dev \
  game-cave:dev
```

#### Multi-Stage Production Build

```dockerfile
# Example production Dockerfile (Dockerfile.prod)
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

For SSR, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy to the Node server and may also serve static assets directly. Example (simplified):

```nginx
# Example nginx.conf (docker+ssr branch)
worker_processes auto;
events { worker_connections 1024; }
http {
   include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
   sendfile      on;
   gzip          on;
   gzip_types    text/plain application/javascript text/css application/json image/svg+xml;

   upstream app {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000; # Node SSR server
   }

   server {
      listen 80;
      server_name _;

      # Serve built assets directly if desired
      location /assets/ {
         root /usr/share/nginx/html;
         access_log off;
         expires 1y;
         add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
      }

      # Proxy everything else to SSR
      location / {
         proxy_pass         http://app;
         proxy_http_version 1.1;
         proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
         proxy_set_header   Connection "upgrade";
         proxy_set_header   Host $host;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
   }
}
```

### 🌐 Network Access & Mobile Testing

```bash
# Run on all interfaces for network access
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:5173:5173 --name game-cave-dev game-cave:dev

# Find your IP address

# Windows PowerShell:
ipconfig | findstr IPv4

# macOS/Linux:
ifconfig | grep inet
```

Now you can test on mobile devices using `http://your-ip:5173`

For Nginx-based production images (docker or docker+ssr branches), map port 5173 and test via `http://your-ip/`.
